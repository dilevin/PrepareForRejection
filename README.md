# PrepareForRejection

This python script sets up my standard set of files for working on research papers. These are:
1. A Google Drive Folder containing
  - A Related Works Spreadsheet
  - A TODO Google Document
  - A Meeting Slides presentation
  - A Google Jam Whiteboard
2. A github repo entitled paper_{PROJECT_NAME} to store the paper latex. 
   The README.md will contain the link to the google folder. 

## Installation

## Running the script

At the command line:
```python start_project.py {PROJECT_NAME}```
